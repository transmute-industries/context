# Extending an existing JSON-LD context

You should start by hosting your own context, both the json file, and the human readable documentation.

If you want to use github pages, you can use this repo as a template to do so:

[https://github.com/transmute-industries/context](https://github.com/transmute-industries/context)

See also this guide on [creating your own context](https://context.transmute.org/json-ld/creating-a-custom-context).

You should make sure all the properties in your context are documented.

You should next open a pull request against the context you wish to update, and its documentation, and cross link the pull requests if they are not in the same repo.

Once your pull request is merged, you can use the updated context, and stop using your own hosted version.

If the code maintainers refused to merge your pull request, or don't want your changes, you will need to continue to host your context and its documentation yourself.
